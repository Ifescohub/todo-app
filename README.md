## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js/) - jQuery
- [jQuery Validation Plugin](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-validation@1.19.5/dist/jquery.validate.js/) - jQuery Plugin
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap/) - For Fonts

### What I learned

This challenge has given me the opportunity to learn a great deal about jQuery and its form validation plugin. WIth this, form validation become more easier and with less code.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to further work on my semantic use of HTML tags. Customizing the jQuery form validation to my best taste is what i will look forward to working on.
